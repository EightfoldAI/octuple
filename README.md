-   Design (and development) work can be created and replicated quickly and at scale.
-   Alleviates strain on design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems.
-   Creates a unified language within and between crossfunctional teams.
-   Creates visual consistency across products, channels, and (potentially siloed) departments.
-   Serves as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and content contributors.
